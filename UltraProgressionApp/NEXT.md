1. Add daily steps and steps over time. Like when taking a walk I wont add to workout but I want the steps to 
count. Though remove daily steps from activity calories etc so I don't count them twice.
2. Add comments to all existing methods and classes so that I know I make sense.
3. Continue from WorkoutMenu.
