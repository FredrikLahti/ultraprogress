## What I've learned (And remembered to add here)

1. Commit more often or keep track of progress somewhere, don't just write, hard to know what was done when. 
2. Don't create a skeleton for project, focus vertical slices, impossible to test without removing or commenting out.
I knew this but I was also afraid I would forget my thought process and instead made a skeleton. Should have kept it in
the notion page.
3. Go for a walk when frustrated, don't cave and ask chatGPT for help when stuck. The amount of code it spits out is
both overwhelming and can really mess up the structure.
4. Be okay with refactoring later. This is to learn, the code probably sucks but if I just refactor as I learn more it
will get better and also fun to see the progress.
